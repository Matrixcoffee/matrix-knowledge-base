# matrix-knowledge-base
FAQs and more. A bot-friendly collection of everything there is to know about Matrix and its ecosystem. Also suitable for human consumption.

## What is this?
This is a community-supported collection of FAQs and more on all things [Matrix](https://matrix.org). Its primary use is to serve as botfood for a yet-to-be-written FAQbot, but it is also suitable for human consumption. More is explained in the [FAQ FAQ](MatrixKB.org#faq-faq).

## Status
**Alpha**. (Rather bare-bones, sparse and ugly, but growing steadily. Oh, and licensing issues.)

## Special features
- Intended for both human consumption and automatic processing. [[more](MatrixKB.org#so-why-another-faq)]

## Contributing
Unfortunately this project cannot accept questions, unless they come with a useful answer included. In the latter case, please make a PR or an issue on the tracker.

Remember that a bot will output your answers into a room. Try to keep them as simple and concise as possible. If something needs a longer, more detailed explanation, use a short explanation and a link. Prefer linking to existing resources, but don't be afraid to author new content if necessary.

Please join [#mkb:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#matrix-knowledge-base:matrix.org) to coordinate efforts.
